<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>This web tool provides a way to securely have a different password for every service you use while at the same time allowing you to only remember one password.
 Simply put in an identifier (which need not be stored securely) along with a master password common to all other passwords and this page will combine those together using a cryptographic hash function to produce a unique password (since it is determined both by the identifier and the master password).</p>
<p>Depending on the site you are visiting, requirements might change so feel free to modify (and hopefully store the modifications along with the identifier) to pass the password requirements.
The passwords generated by this site are incredibly strong, so that won't compromise the security if you say need to put in an @ symbol to have a special character. Generally, though, you can just generate a password to suit your requirements using the length field and the option box for type of password.</p>
<p>The default, special characters, will generate a password with all standard ASCII characters except for spaces. Alphanumeric will use upper and lowercase letters as well as numbers. Numbers will generate a password as a decimal number and hex will output the same number in hexidecimal (characters a-f and 0-9).</p>
<p>While no web tool can be 100% secure, this tool is run entirely through Javascript run on your computer (the server simply renders static content) so your password never leaves your browser. Always look for the lock left of the URL
to ensure you are visiting the site over https!</p>
